        <p>PRODUCTION is a cloud-based project managment application for writers, producer and all manner of magic makers</p>

          <img src=images/moon.png alt="moon">
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>Producing theatrical projects or film requires managing many disciplines and more importantly many different specialty file types and software making producing and organizing difficult. While lots of cloud storage apps support organization and team communication, none support reading or editing of these specific file types. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
          <img src="images/rocket.svg" alt="rocket">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>PRODUCTION makes it easy for artists and producers to collaborate by supporting all major, industry-standard file types including .fdx .cad, and music notation software. </p>

            <h2>49 Total Respondants</h2>
            <h2>Over three-quarters of the have taken part in a collaborative process.</h2>
            <h2>95.7% of respondents are google drive users </h2>
            <h2>Most of them use cloud drives for organization, collaboration, remote file storage</h2>
            <h2>Hardly any use cloud computing apps for content creation.</h2>

          <div class="google drive">

            <h2>Pros</h2>
            <p>Well integrated with G-suite which included G-mail one of the world's most popular email servers.</p>
            <p>15 GB of included storage</p>
            <h2>Cons</h2>
            <p>It is Google so it comes with a lot of privacy and data issues that creatives may find off putting.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="dropbox">
            <img src="dropbox logo 1.png" alt="Drobbox logo">
            <h2>Pros</h2>
            <p>Offers significant privacy features including remote wipe and sharing controls. </p>
            <p>Dropbox’s privacy features are robust enough to earn big ol’ “F” from the chinese government. It’s banned there.</p>
            <h2>Cons</h2>
            <p>The 2GB worth of free storage pales in comparison to Google Drive’s 15GB. If you want a usable amount of storage, you’re going to have to shell out some money for it. </p>

            <h2>Pros</h2>
            <p>Offers real time remote collaboration on plays and screenplays. It has editing and file storage as well.</p>
            <h2>Cons</h2>
            <p>That’s all it does. Sharing a file with a non-user still requires file conversion or for the receiver to have specific software. It’s also pretty bare bones when it comes to collaboration aspect. No notifications and no notes. Just the real time collaboration. </p>

        <p>To make a piece of art is hard. Its natural state is to exist inside the maker's head. Always perfect but never seen by anyone else. It only takes one person to come up with an idea but it takes a team of people constantly communicating and encouraging each other to make that idea a reality. That’s why I designed “PRODUCTION”  </p>
        <p>To produce. To make something. PRODUCTION should not just encourage creativity but also add a tangibility to the work. Adding voices and collaboration to the process creates a palpable sense of urgency that helps propel an idea to a draft to a production-ready script. </p>

          <img src="images/Logo sketch.png" alt="Logo sketch">
          <p>As for the logo. I explored a lot of different ideas around the idea of growing something from the mind. There are a few crude drawings of brains or brains becoming butterflies. Those… didn’t work. My favorite is the lightbulb. Lighting is obviously a major feature of both film and theater production (aka our target users). </p>
          <p>To come up with the name I created a list. First, of different production documents, I found that to be fairly cold. It may work for production administration but it would leave the creatives out. (Not that producers and administrators aren’t creative). Then I started thinking about creativity terms that implied growing something. Things like spark and cocoon. I actually settled on “PRODUCTION” because it satisfies both the administrative and creative users. Production isn’t a destination. It’s a process. It’s where plans are made and executed. </p>

            <p>As for colors. I wanted a cozy feeling. I settled on a burgundy and tan color scheme. To me, it felt like curling up next to the fire. </p>

          <div id="iteration 2">
            <img src="images/colors 2.png" alt="iteration 2">
            <p>This is a later iteration. User testing and feedback proved that I had made a mistake with the tans and green. Here I added a blue to really give it a nice pop as well continue to foster creativity. </p>

        <p>I tested the iconography and the hero image. There was a pretty clear winner in all but the header image option. However, both the icons went the way I thought they would go so I just went with my instinct.</p>

        <h1>conclusion</h1>
        <p>The development and design process comes with lots of twist and turns. I tried to keep my eyes on the problem and kept working toward crafting a solution that would satisfy all the stakeholders and keep a creative vision throughout. I believe that with this project writers and producers of all levels will improve creativity and communication. </p>
