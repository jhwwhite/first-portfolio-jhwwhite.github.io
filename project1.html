            <h4>Most of them use cloud drives for organization, collaboration, remote file storage</h4>

            <p>That’s all it does. Sharing a file with a non-user still requires file conversion or for the receiver to have specific software. It’s also pretty bare bones when it comes to collaboration aspect. No notifications and no notes. Just the real time collaboration. </p>

            <p>To make a piece of art is hard. Its natural state is to exist inside the maker's head. Always perfect but never seen by anyone else. It only takes one person to come up with an idea but it takes a team of people constantly communicating and encouraging each other to make that idea a reality. That’s why I designed “PRODUCTION” </p>
            <p>To produce. To make something. PRODUCTION should not just encourage creativity but also add a tangibility to the work. Adding voices and collaboration to the process creates a palpable sense of urgency that helps propel an idea to a draft to a production-ready script. </p>

            <h4>Logo</h4>
            <img src="images/pencil.jpg" alt="Pencil">
            <p>As for the logo. I explored a lot of different ideas around the idea of growing something from the mind. There are a few crude drawings of brains or brains becoming butterflies. Those… didn’t work. My favorite is the lightbulb. Lighting is obviously a major feature of both film and theater production (aka our target users).  </p>
          </div>
          <div class="name">
            <p>To come up with the name I created a list. First, of different production documents, I found that to be fairly cold. It may work for production administration but it would leave the creatives out. (Not that producers and administrators aren’t creative). Then I started thinking about creativity terms that implied growing something. Things like spark and cocoon. I actually settled on “PRODUCTION” because it satisfies both the administrative and creative users. Production isn’t a destination. It’s a process. It’s where plans are made and executed. </p>

              <p>As for colors. I wanted a cozy feeling. I settled on a burgundy and tan color scheme. To me, it felt like curling up next to the fire. </p>

              <p>This is a later iteration. User testing and feedback proved that I had made a mistake with the tans and green. Here I added a blue to really give it a nice pop as well continue to foster creativity.</p>

                <p>You’ll undoubtedly notice that there are no mobile user flows. That is intentional. Long-form dramatic writing is still in the realms of keyboards and cursors. This doesn’t mean that mobile usability could not be implemented in the future. However, to solve the problem and to create a minimum viable product I stuck to a desktop app. </p>
