    <p>If you asked five-year-old me what I wanted to be when I grew up I’d have told you that I wanted to be a jet pilot (I’d just watched Top Gun). If you asked me that same question when I was 18, I’d have said I wanted to be an actor. 25? I wanted to be a comedian. 30? A writer. And it has all led me to the now, a UX designer.</p>
    <p>Life hasn’t moved in a straight line for me. (Does it for anyone?) I had dreams of being an actor that carried me from Dallas to Chicago when I was 22 years old. Since then I’ve acted, I’ve written, I’ve hosted, I’ve taught, and I’ve waited on a lot of tables. Through all of that, I’ve been fortunate enough to constantly be creating something: a play, a lesson plan, or just crafting the perfect joke to bring a problem table back around. </p>
